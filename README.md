#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is systematically applied engineering principle, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintainance.
Importance in the technology industry -> software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modernn life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healtcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of software engineering traces back to the 1940s and 1950s with the emergence of the first digital computers.Over the years, software engineering has evolved in response to the growing complexity of software systems and the need for structed development methodologies
The three key milestones are ;
1)The stablixhment of software engineering as a dicipline in the 1060s
2)The development of programming languages like fortran, C.
3)The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
!) requirements:-> It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2) Design:-> It involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3) Implementation:-> Here we write code and build the software according to the design specifications
4) Testing:-> This involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets standards and functional requirements.
5) Deployment:-> This involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6) Maintenance:-> Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements sto the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is linear and sequential which follows a strict order of phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintanence.Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next , with little to no overlap. While Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach .It incremental approach focus on flexibility, collaboration, and reponding to change.
Scenarious:
waterfall-> Building a bridge or a building, where the design must be completed before construction begins, and changes during construction could be costly or impractical.
Agile->  Building a new software application where customer requirements may evolve, and continuous feedback is needed to refine the product.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-> The role of a software developer is to write code and implementsoftware solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-> ensures software quality by desgining and executing test plans.
Project Manager-> He/She getsto oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development Environments  also known as IDEs is a software engineering suites that provides comphrehensive tools for writing , debugging, and testing code. Examples are Visual studio, Atom, Eclipse,Intellij IDEA.
Version Contorl Sysytems also referred to as VCS is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinate work among team members. Examples are Git, subversion e.t.c.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements-> Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines-> Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt-> Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges-> Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing-> This involves testing individual components or modules of software
Integration Testing-> This involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing-> is testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance Testing-> is testing the sodtware against user requirement to ensure it meets user needs.
The importance in software quality assurance is to measure quality control such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration which helps identify and fix defectsearly in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is defined by crafting your questions or instructions or statements in a way that helps get the best response from AI assistance or models.
The importance in interacting with AI models is uch that whenever you are asking a vague question and getting a confusing answer, propt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the Ai understands exactly what you need .

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt-> " can you help me with a project?"
Improved Prompt-> can you help me design a user-friendly dashboard for tacking patient health metrics using react and bootsrap? I need assistance with layout, component selection and best practices for data  visualation."
The improved prompt is more effective because its specific and exact which to design a dashboard for tracking patient health metrics unlike the vague prompt which did not specify the kind of project and also the tool that will be use to build the project and so the improved prompt provides all the necessary information upfront,thereby making it easier for the recipent to provide relevant and accurate assiatance, which saves time and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings.
